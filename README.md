# Automobile Data Dashboard ‚Äì User Manual

This is a guide to help you use the Automobile Data Dashboard, an Angular + Firebase app to view and manage automobile data.

## 1. Viewing Automobile Data

- On initial load, the full dataset is loaded from Firebase Firestore.
- Data is presented in a table format with columns such as Name, MPG, Cylinders, Horsepower, etc.
- Pagination allows easy navigation through large datasets.

## 2. Search and Sort

**Search**:

- Use the ‚ÄúSearch by automobile name‚Äù input to find specific automobiles.
- The search is case-insensitive and applies to the name field only.

**Sort**:

- Use the dropdown to sort by any field (e.g., Name, MPG, Weight).
- Choose ascending or descending order.
- Search and sort preferences are saved automatically to localStorage and restored on reload.

## 3. Add a New Automobile

- Click "Add New Automobile" to display the form.
- Fill out all fields (name, mpg, cylinders, etc.). All fields are required.
- Click "Save Automobile" to store it in Firebase Firestore.
- On success, the table will automatically update.

## 4. Remove an Automobile

- Click the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button in the "Actions" column for an automobile.
- A confirmation will appear. On confirmation, the automobile will be removed from Firestore and UI.

## 5. Download as CSV

- Click the ‚ÄúDownload CSV‚Äù button to download the current filtered + sorted automobile list.
- Only rows that match the search and sort are downloaded ‚Äî not just the visible page.

## 6. Pagination

- Pagination is used for better performance and UX on large datasets (300+ records).
- Navigate using previous/next buttons at the bottom of the table.
